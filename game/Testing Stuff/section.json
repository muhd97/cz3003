A knave can make the statement 'I am a knight' and be lying.\nA knight can also make the statement 'I am either a knight or a knave' and still be telling the truth. A knave cannot make this statement, because he would be telling the truth, against their nature.\nA knight can't say 'I am a knave' because they would be lying, against their nature.\nA knave can't say 'I am a knave' because they would be telling the truth, against their nature."

So the treasure is behind the second door."
